sudo3abcs906-0d3c-4570-9e85-f80dtypically indicates that the parser or interpreter encountered an unexpected end to a block or statement, which it was expecting to be closed with a particular character or syntax.

In the code snippet provided, the issue arises from the JSON configuration block at the beginning, which is not properly formatted. JSON requires that any object definition starts. However, there is a comment following the closing `
}` that is not valid JSON syntax and is likely causing the parser to misinterpret the structure, he

Here are a few possible solutions:

1. **Remove the Comment from JSON**: If the comment is not needed in the JSON configuration, simply remove it. JSON does not support # Using npx (no installation required)
npx @google/gemini-clip install -g @google/gemini-cli
sudo3acbb906-0d3c-4570-9e85-f80d9f282305

port install gemini-cli
.

    ```json
    {
"iis.configDir": ""
}
    ```

2. **Use a Valid Comment Syntax**: If you need to keep the comment, consider using a different syntax that is valid in the context. However, since this is JSON, comments are not allowed. You can use a different file for comments or keep the comment in a different format if this JSON is part of a larger script or configuration file.

3. **Separate JSON and Comments**: If the JSON and the comment need to coexist in the same file, consider separating them with a different delimiter or by placing the comment outside of the JSON block.

    ```json
    {
"iis.configDir": ""
}
// Using npx (no installation required)
    ```

    Note: The above comment uses ` //` which is a JavaScript comment syntax and would work if this JSON is part of a JavaScript file. If it's a standalone JSON file, comments are not supported.

4. **Check the Entire File**: Ensure that the entire file is properly formatted and that there are no other issues causing the parser to misinterpret the structure.

If the JSON block is part of a larger configuration file that supports comments, make sure to use the correct comment syntax for that file type. For pure JSON, comments should be removed.
